## Questions and answers about R learning   

What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  

I'd like to talk about R and Python. R is well-suited for statistical analysis and has a strong focus on the statistical domain, while Python provides a broader range of applications and has become a popular choice for machine learning and general-purpose programming. 


What functionality do you like about R?  

I like the packages and libraries. The packages and libraries of R are very useful, and make statistical modeling, data visualization, and data manipulation easier.


What parts do you miss about your other language?  

Python has a wide range of applications beyond data analysis, the syntax is easy to read and write, and is easy for beginners to learn and collaborate with others. 

Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)  

Until now, I think R is not that difficult, but it takes lots of time to master.

## Example R Markdown output

```{r figure}
plot(iris)
```


## Image

```{r image1}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "../images/")
```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
